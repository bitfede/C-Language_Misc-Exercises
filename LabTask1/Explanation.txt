Describe the difference between wc `grep -l int *` and wc * | grep -l int. Why is it not giving the same output? Put the answer into a text file named Explanation.txt.(0.5%)
---------------

$ wc `grep -l int *` 
-has backticks, meaning that grep will be executed before anything else. Then the output of it will be used as an argument for wc line by line

$ wc * | grep -l int
is different because wc will be executed first, and its whole entire output will be piped into grep, which will extract what's needed
